Notes

One of the main challenges encountered was configuring camera permissions correctly in the Info.plist file to prevent the app from crashing when launching the camera. Additionally, handling photo metadata and extracting time and location data required careful optional handling and user permission management.

Implementing the 24-hour visibility restriction logic also required precise date comparisons and filtering posts based on the logged-in user’s last upload.
